        <h1 id="welcome-to-pci-proxy">Welcome to PCI Proxy</h1>

<p>PCI Proxy is a service that can <strong>securely collect, store and forward credit cards</strong> (payment data) to any payment gateway (e.g. Stripe) or other PCI-certified third party (e.g. Expedia). It can even <strong>extract payment data out of web service calls</strong> (e.g. Booking.com) while allowing the message body to remain unaffected. By using tokenization, our APIs ensure <strong>sensitive payment data never touches your system environment</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="sample-business-cases">Sample Business Cases</h3>

<p>The following list of business cases is not complete and should only give an overview of business types that already use PCI Proxy.</p>

<h4 id="middle-office">Middle Office</h4>

<p><em>You are a middle office that receives booking information on behalf of your clients.</em></p>

<p><em>Travel agencies use your software to drop new bookings. At some point, they will enter the customersâ€™ payment data in your software. In order to minimize your PCI scope, this payment data should be added without touching your server.</em></p>

<p>PCI Proxy supports a varienty of <a href="#collect">different approaches for you to collect the payment data</a>. The most common approach is to submit data directly from your software using our <a href="#paymentpages">payment pages</a>. Another option is <a href="#paybyemail">pay-by-email</a> where payment links are issued that can be emailed to customers to let them enter their payment details by them-selves. Now you have shielded your server by using our APIs to extract and collect payment data and stored it in our PCI Proxy vault up front.</p>

<p><em>On behalf of your clients you want to process the booking or transact with different endpoints (e.g. Expedia, Stripe, TUI, Lufthansa, etc.).</em></p>

<p>PCI Proxy allows you to <a href="#forward">forward vaulted payment data</a> to PCI compliant third parties.</p>

<h4 id="channel-manager">Channel Manager</h4>

<p><em>You are a channel manager that requests or receives booking information from distribution channels, e.g. <a href="http://www.booking.com/">Booking.com</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>Hotels and accommodation providers transmit availabilities and prices to various distribution channels. It also automatically retrieves bookings including payment data from the online booking platforms.</em></p>

<p>PCI Proxy allows you to <a href="#extract">extract payment data from web service calls</a> and securely store it in PCI Proxys&rsquo; vault. Your server will never get in touch with sensitive card data which reduces your PCI scope immediately.</p>

<p><em>Generally, you will store payment data only to allow your hotels to charge cards in case of a no-show.</em></p>

<p>PCI Proxy provides several ways on how to <a href="#use">use stored payment data</a>. Your clients can either <a href="#retrieve">retrieve payment data</a> via NoShow.jsp, <a href="#charge">charge payment data</a> against a payment processor or <a href="#forward">forward payment data</a> to a PCI-compliant third party, eg. Expedia.</p>
