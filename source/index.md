Welcome to PCI Proxy
===================

PCI Proxy is a service that can **securely collect, store and forward credit cards** (payment data) to any payment gateway (e.g. Stripe) or other PCI-certified third party (e.g. Expedia). It can even **extract payment data out of web service calls** (e.g. Booking.com) while allowing the message body to remain unaffected. By using tokenization, our APIs ensure **sensitive payment data never touches your system environment**.

###Sample Business Cases
The following list of business cases is not complete and should only give an overview of business types that already use PCI Proxy.

#### Middle Office

*You are a middle office that receives booking information on behalf of your clients.*

*Travel agencies use your software to drop new bookings. At some point, they will enter the customersâ€™ payment data in your software. In order to minimize your PCI scope, this payment data should be added without touching your server.*

PCI Proxy supports a varienty of [different approaches for you to collect the payment data][1]. The most common approach is to submit data directly from your software using our [payment pages][2]. Another option is [pay-by-email][3] where payment links are issued that can be emailed to customers to let them enter their payment details by them-selves. Now you have shielded your server by using our APIs to extract and collect payment data and stored it in our PCI Proxy vault up front.

*On behalf of your clients you want to process the booking or transact with different endpoints (e.g. Expedia, Stripe, TUI, Lufthansa, etc.).*

PCI Proxy allows you to [forward vaulted payment data][4] to PCI compliant third parties.

#### Channel Manager

*You are a channel manager that requests or receives booking information from distribution channels, e.g. [Booking.com][5].*

*Hotels and accommodation providers transmit availabilities and prices to various distribution channels. It also automatically retrieves bookings including payment data from the online booking platforms.*

PCI Proxy allows you to [extract payment data from web service calls][6] and securely store it in PCI Proxys' vault. Your server will never get in touch with sensitive card data which reduces your PCI scope immediately.

*Generally, you will store payment data only to allow your hotels to charge cards in case of a no-show.*

PCI Proxy provides several ways on how to [use stored payment data][7]. Your clients can either [retrieve payment data][8] via NoShow.jsp, [charge payment data][9] against a payment processor or [forward payment data][4] to a PCI-compliant third party, eg. Expedia.
